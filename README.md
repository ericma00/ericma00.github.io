# Summary
A phylogetic explorable developed by Eric Ma (me), Rebecca Ta, and Saralyn Santos for our Data Visualization Final Project in the Winter 2018.

# Purpose
One of the purpose of this project is to learn how to use D3.js, a JavaScript data visualization library. At the same time, hoping that people that are taking introductory biology class will find this useful when they learn start learning about the phylogenetic tree.

# Process

### Planning:
We first got in contact with [Dr. Herron](https://www.biology.washington.edu/people/profile/jon-herron), a Senior Lecturer and a Evolutionary Biology expert at University of Washington and asked for his expertise on ways to teach the concept of phylogenetic tree. 
After listing down all the things he gave us as well as some google searches on various tree concepts, we moved on to the design phase.

### Design:
This took a while since there were many different ways to present the data. After various iterations, we came up with 3 different data visualizations: an interactive tree that highlights the tree branches when user click on the leaf of the tree, an interactive tree that maps out different terminologies of the tree on the visualization, and finally a quiz.

[This](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ucLlXpbf1e_pjCOP8_iTceXWqAwm_f2r/view?usp=sharing) was the planning notes and wireframes for our project 

### Implementation: 
This project mainly uses d3.js for the interactive visualizations. Other than that, everything else was HTML, CSS (a lot of it), and JavaScript. 

# Conclusion
After implementation, we wrote a paper about this entire project [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12ks_LnfAh7hMILNlWOvTKOXIiTzmI7Tj/view?usp=sharing)
